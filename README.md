# React - Webpack GitHub template

## How to

- First use `yarn install`. If you don't want to use yarn you can remove the `yarn.lock` file and then use `npm install`
- `yarn start` will watch files and start a local dev server
- `yarn build`. The name says it all :)
- `yarn test` for Jest to start.
    - `yarn test --watch` to start watching file changes
    - `yarn test --coverage` if you want to generate a coverage report. This report will be saved inside `.reports` folder.

## React Testing Library
We are using [react-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)
> *Simple and complete React DOM testing utilities that encourage good testing practices.*

## ToDo
- [x] Jest suite
- [ ] ESLint (JS and React)
- [ ] Remove this ToDo when completed :)
